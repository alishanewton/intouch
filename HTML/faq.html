<h3 id="h3_0"><b>Payment</b>
</h3>
<p>
  <b>Q:&nbsp;Am I considered an employee or 1099 independent contractor?&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>
  A: You can choose whether you would like to be a W4 employee or W9 independent contractor. Fill out the appropriate tax form and return it to Sunny.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Q:</b><b>&nbsp;When is my first payday? When does payment usually process?</b>
</p>
<p>
  A: Payment is processed on the 5th and 20th days of every month. You must complete a full pay cycle before receiving your first payment. For example, if&nbsp;you start on the 15th of the month, your first pay day will be the 5th day of the next month.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Q: How does the incentive payment&nbsp;work? Do I need to keep track of it myself?&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>
  A: The calculations for the incentive&nbsp;are completed automatically by the system. You may keep your own records, but it can be difficult to accurately track absences and averages. If you would like to request a copy of the calculations used to determine your incentive, email Sunny.
</p>
<h3 id="h3_0"><b>Teaching</b>
</h3>
<p>
  <b>Q:&nbsp;Do I need to complete the monthly evaluations for all students who have been assigned to me?</b>
</p>
<p>
  A: Because students are assigned to the teacher with whom they had class most recently, you may be assigned students after just one or two classes with them. If you have had class with a student less than three times, there is no need to complete that student&#39;s evaluation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <b>Q: What if my student has not yet completed a level test?</b>
</p>
<p>
  A: Please make report on the staff notice board if a student has not completed a level test.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <b>Q: Are there any topics that are off-limits?</b>
</p>
<p>
  A: Avoid discussing&nbsp;politics, religion, illegal drugs, or anything related to sex. If the student wants to discuss these topics, you may do so, but never argue with the student.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
  <b>Q: What do I do if a student tells me that they have been drinking alcohol?</b>
</div>
<p>
  A: If you think the student is not able to have class due to any reason, you may encourage them to cancel the&nbsp;class or have a short class.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <b>Q. What do I do if a student makes me feel uncomfortable?</b>
</p>
<p>
  A: Do not get angry or end the call. Gently decline to answer or try to change the subject.&nbsp;If a&nbsp;student asks unsuitable questions, make a report directly to Sunny Kim.</p><p><i>Should you have any further questions, please do not to hesitate to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sunny@in-touch.co.kr?subject=Question" title="Click here to email Sunny" target="_top">email Sunny Kim</a>.</i></p><hr/><p><ul class="CHSeeAlso"><li style="display:inline"><a href="requirements.html" onclick="return n(&#39;!intouch-learning-inc/requirements&#39;,this);">Requirements</a></li><li style="display:inline"> | </li><li style="display:inline"><a href="salary.html" onclick="return n(&#39;!intouch-learning-inc/salary&#39;,this);">Salary</a></li><li style="display:inline"> | </li><li style="display:inline"><a href="holidays-2018.html" onclick="return n(&#39;!intouch-learning-inc/holidays-2018&#39;,this);">Annual Holidays</a></li></ul><br/></p></body></html>
